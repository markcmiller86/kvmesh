title: What is KVMesh?
---
KVMesh is an example of scientific computing data stored as a large folder hierarchy
of CSV, key-value files to facilitate processing by big data analytics technologies
like [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org) or [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org).

<br>
 
Unlike unstructured text typical of big data applications, scientific computing data
is highly structured with many logical, geometrical and mathematical relationships some
of which are illustrated in the pictures here. Algorithms to process scientific data
must take these relationships into account. This makes KVMesh a somewhat unique
database to try to work with using big data technologies.

<br>
 
We have created the KVMesh database and codebase to share and encourage research and
development of data analytics approaches to scientific data query, analysis and
visualization.
